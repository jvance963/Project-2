CONCEPT

Not all of us are good at every-thing and sometimes we need help.

One may usually use something like https://www.taskrabbit.com/dashboard for their needs for around the house. However, what if your needs extend beyond the every-day jobs around the house.

I am interested in building an application that helps everyone navigate through life and leverage the community around them to become successful in their daily or work lives.

CRUD Functionality

CREATE User
CREATE Job
CREATE Handyman
CREATE Response from Handyman
READ All Responses from Handyman
READ Job
UPDATE Response from Handyman
UPDATE Job
DELETE Job
DELETE User

CONSIDERATIONS

I will be a challenge to link everything together and making the MVC work correctly.

I plan on using {{{ handlebars }}}for my template library.

I am thinking about using feathers but I have to look into it a little more.

REACH

I will think about this while I am building the application.
