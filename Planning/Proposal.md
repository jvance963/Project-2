Concept

Not all of us are good at every-thing and sometimes we need help.

One may usually use something like https://www.taskrabbit.com/dashboard for their needs for around the house. However, what if your needs extend beyond the every-day jobs around the house.

I am interested in building an application that helps everyone navigate through life and leverage the community around them to become successful in their daily or work lives.
